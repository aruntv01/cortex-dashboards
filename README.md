# Dashboards for managing Cortex

These are the dashboards used internally at Weaveworks for our
[Cortex](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex) instances.

They are written in Python using
[Grafanalib](https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib).

Some aspects are specific to the Weave Cloud infrastructure, e.g. the
use of DynamoDB for storage.
